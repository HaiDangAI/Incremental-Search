                            Project 7: Incremental Search
1. Introduction
	In this project, you will learn how to design and implement an incremental search feature 
like Google Instant. Incremental search or real-time suggestions is a user interface interaction 
method to progressively search for and filter through text. As the user type text, one or more 
possible matches for the text are found and immediately presented to the user. This immediate 
feedback often allows the user to stop short of typing the entire word or phrase they were looking 
for. The user may also choose a closely related option from the presented list.
2. Your task
    Build an application with incremental search feature (e.g. web browsers, search instant, code completion)
3. Optional
    For extra mark, you may consider some other effective datastructure and algorithm design support 
this feature for searching in large dataset.
